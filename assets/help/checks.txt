This analysis performs some simple checks on your application:

- BAD_CLASSNAME: spots non-standard classnames, for instance non-capitalized 
- BAD_EQ: possibly wrong use of .equals() instead of ==, or vice versa
- BAD_OVERRIDE: possibly wrong argument types or method name in overriding methods
- CALL_SUPER: possibly wrong policy while calling super() in overriding methods
- CLASSCAST: possibly wrong classcast
- FIELD_NEVER_READ: a field is never read in reachable code
- FIELD_NEVER_USED: a field is never used in reachable code
- FIELD_NEVER_WRITTEN: a field is never written in reachable code
- SET_STATIC_IN_NON_STATIC: a static field is assigned from a non-static context
- UNCALLED: a method or constructor is never called from the application
- USELESS_ASSIGNMENT: a local variable is assigned but never used again later

The total number of reachable methods must not exceed 15,000 (this includes library methods). This protects our server from overloading and guarantees a response in at most 30 minutes.

If you need to analyze larger applications, please buy a licence of our software and install it on a powerful computer. 8 gigabytes of RAM are enough for 15,000 methods. More memory allows larger analyses.
