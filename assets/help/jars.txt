List here the jar files that Julia will analyze. Warnings are reported for application jars, but not for library jars. Both kinds of jars are analyzed.

You don't have to add all library jars used by your applications. More library jars mean a more precise analysis but a more expensive and long computation. So populate this list with care.

As a rule of thumb, you should add only those library jars that might contain call-backs to your application code, or otherwise the analysis of Julia might not cover your application completely and it might yield incorrect results.

For nullness analysis, Julia automatically includes classes from java.* and javax.swing.*. For termination analysis, Julia automatically includes classes from java.lang.* and java.util.*. Hence, you do not have to include those classes explicitly. In general, do not add jars containing other classes from the standard Java library.
